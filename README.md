# Inkscape-icons

This a dual tone version of icons used inside Inkscape 1.0 based on `hicolor` pack included in 

Source : https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/tree/1.0.x

**Respective license apply. I prefer attribution if possible and no closed source packaging.**

The original `hicolor` pack is single colour which has now been converted to dual tone ( two colours ). It is not 100 % complete. But most of the normal UI is now dual tone.

To use them in Ubuntu and related distros,

.config > inkscape > icon 

place the icon pack folder inside. To activate the new icon theme, in Inkscape 1.0, go to

edit > preferences > Interface > Theme

**Disclaimer** :

Please don't blame me if something goes wrong. I take no responsibility. You can choose not to use this pack if you are not sure what to do.
